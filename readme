Sets of images should be grouped into top-level folders by shared background conditions.

Each top-level folder must contain three things:
1. A folder containing 16-bit grayscale .tif background images
2. A folder containing 16-bit grayscale .tif signal images
3. A text file "boxes.txt" with the following format:
  xrange
  yrange
  xbox
  ybox
e.g.
  5:142
  1:450
  100:135
  230:270

The ranges are the x and y pixel dimensions of the cuvette window
The boxes are the x and y pixel dimensions of the maximum-intensity region within the cuvette window
